## Markdown

There are some custom blocks for Markdown(will be automatically converted to styled blocks).

### Set meta data

You have to set post meta data in frontmatter(At the top of each markdown file).

```
title: Example title
date: "2019-01-28T22:40:32.169Z"
description: "This text will be used as meta/og description"
category: "design"
emoji: "üòÅ"
```

_cagegory: must be just 1 category_
_emoji: converted to Twemoji and used as HeroImage_

### Custom Blocks

```
[[simple | title here]]

```

#### Alert block

make sure the ads are shown only on production.
